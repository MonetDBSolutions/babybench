# babybench
The famous TPC-H SF-1 benchmark 
The BabyBench is the 'hello-world' example to demonstrate and test the functionality of SQALPEL. It is based on the [TPC-H](https://tpc.org) benchmark defined by the Transaction Processing Counsel. Babybench uses the rather limited scale-factor 1, which means a database of about 1GB. The results we get from running experiments on such a tiny database is **not** indicative for the performance when we scale up to a multi -GB database.
